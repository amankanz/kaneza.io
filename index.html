            <blockquote>
              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Hello, world! My name is Kaneza, and I'm excited to share my
                  first journal entry with you. This space will be where I
                  document my experiences, challenges, and triumphs as I
                  navigate the path of becoming a full-stack developer. Today,I
                  want to take you through the story of how I found my passion
                  for technology and decided to pursue a career in tech.<span
                    id="dots"
                    >...</span
                  >
                </p>
                <div id="more" class="hide-content">
                  <h4>The Spark of Curiosity</h4>
                  <p>
                    My journey began with a simple curiosity about how websites
                    worked. I remember spending hours online, fascinated by the
                    seamless interaction between users and digital platforms.
                    One day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I
                    turned to YouTube, that vast sea of knowledge, and started
                    watching tutorials on HTML and CSS. The thrill of seeing my
                    first lines of code transform into a functional webpage was
                    indescribable. I was hooked.
                  </p>

                  <h4>The Self-Taught Hustle</h4>
                  <p>
                    For months, I immersed myself in the world of web
                    development through YouTube. I followed tutorials, built
                    small projects, and slowly started to understand the
                    fundamentals of coding. But as I delved deeper, I realized
                    that I needed more than just online videos. I needed
                    structure, guidance, and a community of like-minded
                    individuals who shared my passion.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Taking the Leap with Kreativstrom</h4>
                  <p>
                    That's when I decided to enroll in a training program with
                    <a
                      href="https://credsverse.com/credentials/e7e72939-fbf7-468f-86d5-0299b3a07673"
                      target="_blank"
                      >Kreativstrom</a
                    >. I knew that formal training would not only provide me
                    with a solid foundation in web development but also give me
                    the opportunity to connect with other aspiring tech
                    professionals. The program was intense, covering everything
                    from basic HTML and CSS to more advanced JavaScript. It was
                    challenging, but every bit worth it.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Embracing the Challenge</h4>
                  <p>
                    Balancing my studies with personal responsibilities was no
                    easy feat. There were late nights, early mornings, and
                    countless moments of doubt. But each challenge only
                    strengthened my resolve. I learned to manage my time better,
                    stay focused, and push through obstacles. The sense of
                    accomplishment I felt after completing each project kept me
                    motivated.
                  </p>

                  <h4>The Next Chapter: ZTM Academy</h4>
                  <p>
                    After completing my training with Kreativstrom, I knew I
                    wanted to take my skills to the next level. I enrolled in

                    full-stack developer. The journey is demanding, but the
                    progress I see in myself keeps me motivated. With each new
                    concept I learn, I feel more confident and prepared for the
                    tech industry.

                  <h4>Vision and Goals</h4>
                  <p>
                    My ultimate goal is not only to succeed in the tech industry
                    but to do so in a way that aligns with my values of
                    financial stability, spiritual growth, moral integrity, and
                    good health. I aspire to create solutions that make a
                    positive impact and to inspire others who are on a similar
                    path.
